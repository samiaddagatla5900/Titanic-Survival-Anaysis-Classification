# Titanic-Survival-Anaysis-Classification
This dataset gives an opportunity to explore different classification algorithms in machine learning.The focus is on handling null values by utilising mean and mode imputation.
After addressing the missing values, the data is split into training and testing sets. Then, various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifier etc. are applied to the data. To improve the reliability of the models, K-Fold Cross Validation is used.
By utilizing different classification algorithms and K-Fold Cross Validation, this notebook provides a comprehensive approach to understanding and implementing classification techniques in machine learning.
